This is the list of all the icons for which we need special versions.

Check the examples in case you haven't understood from text, is much simplier sometimes =)

---
How to use it:

- First, give a hand in completing the list. When you find an icon that
  needs a special version, please add it here, in the "General" section.
  Do the same, when the special version of an icon is not updated, but
  in that please case add the icon also in the "Outdated" section, and 
  uncheck ([*] --> []) the corrispetive icon in the "General" section.
  The "General" part will contain all the icons that need a special
  version.

- When you do a new icon that does not scale perfectly at small sizes
  (aka you need a special version), add an (unchecked) entry in the 
  "General" section with the name of the icon and the sizes you need.

- When you significantly update an icon, and you feel also the new
  special version needs to be updated or even redone, please uncheck
  the corrispetive entry in the "General" list. After that, please add
  an entry in the "Outdated" section, putting just the name, without any
  checkbox.

How to update it when you do a small version:

- If you have (re)made an *OUTDATED* icon, please remove the entry
  from the "Outdated" section, and re-check the checkbox in "General".
  ***NOTE: Do *NOT* remove the entry from the "General" section!!***
  Please update all the needed sizes in this case

- If you have made a *MISSING* special version for an icon, please check the
  corrispective checkbox, in case you did all the needed versions. If not write
  in the checkbox the sizes you made. See the examples.

Syntax Examples:

-- General --
    []   foo   16 22    <-- Special versions for 16x16 and 22x22 are needed
    [16] foo   16 22    <-- Special version is needed just for 22x22, 16x16 is already done
    [*]  foo   16 22    <-- All the needed special versions have been made

-- Outdated --
    foo               <-- All the special versions of 'foo' are outdated (see the "General"
                          section to know which sizes are needed). Please update it the sooner
                          the possible. When you update it, please update all the sizes.
